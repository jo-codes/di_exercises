          <b>companionship.</b>

          There are more than seventy cat breeds recognized by various cat
          registries..

        <h1>The lions</h1>
        <hr />
        <p>
          Present in Africa and India, the lion typically inhabits grasslands
          and savannahs, but is absent in dense forests. It is usually more
          diurnal than other big cats, but when persecuted adapts to being
          active at night and at twilight. A lion pride consists of a few adult
          males, related females and cubs. Prides vary in size and composition
          from three to 20 adult lions, depending on habitat and prey
          availability. Females cooperate when hunting and prey mostly on large
          ungulates, including antelope, deer, buffalo, zebra and even giraffe.
