# Daily challenge :
# Text Analysis

# Download my_text.txt

#     Write a class called Text, it accepts a string as argument and store the text in a attribute.
#     Implement the following:
#         a method to return the frequency of a word in the text (assume words are separated by whitespace) return None or meaningful message
#         a method that returns the most common word in the text
#         a method that returns a list of the unique words in the text
#         a classmethod that returns a instance of Text but with a text file: >>> Text.from_file('my_text.txt')
#     Write a TextModification class that inherits from Text
#     Implement the following:
#         a method that returns the text without punctuation
#         a method that returns the text without english stop-words (check out what this is !!)
#         a method that returns the text without special characters

# Now, use the provided txt file and try using the class you created above.
# Provide a meaningful word frequency insight (meaning if ‘the’ is the most used word it is no surprise, try to come up with a way to get something better).

# Note: Feel free to implement every attribute or method or function to succeed, be creative
