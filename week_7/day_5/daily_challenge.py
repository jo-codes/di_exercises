# Daily challenge : Reverse bits

# Write a Python function to reverse the bits of an integer (32 bits unsigned). Go to the editor
# Input : 1234
# Output : 1260388352
# For example, 1234 represented in binary as 10011010010 and returns 1260388352 which represents in binary as 01001011001000000000000000000000
