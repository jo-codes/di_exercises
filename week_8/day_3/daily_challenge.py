# Daily challenge :
# DNA

# This challenge is about Biology.

#     Build a DNA object. DNA is composed of chromosomes who is itself composed of Genes.
#         A Gene is a single value 0 or 1, it can mutate (flip).
#         A Chromosome is a serie of 10 Genes. It also can mutate, meaning a random number of genes can randomly flip (1/2 chance to flip).
#         A DNA is a serie of 10 chromosome, and it can also mutate the same way Chromosomes can.

#     Implement these classes as you see fit.
#     Create a new class called `Organism√® that accepts a DNA object and a environement parameter that sets the probability for its DNA to mutate.
#     Instantiate a number of Organims and let them mutate until one gets to a DNA is only made of 1s. Then stop and record the number of generations (iterations) it took.

# Write your results in you personal biology research notebook and tell us your conclusion :).

# gene x 10. let's just code a gene class
