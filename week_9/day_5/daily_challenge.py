# Daily challenge : Checkers

# Implement a checkers game

# You can find the rules here : https://www.thesprucecrafts.com/play-checkers-using-standard-rules-409287

# Make sure you display the board at each turn and that you are not allowing illegal moves. Stop when one player wins. You can either make the computer play (good luck with that !) or make two human users play. 

# Come back to this if you have time
