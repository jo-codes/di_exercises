# Hint: Look at the remote learning “Matrix”
# Daily challenge : Solve the Matrix

# The matrix is a grid of strings (alphanumeric characters and spaces) with a hidden message in it.
# To decrypt the matrix, Neo reads each column from top to bottom, starting from the leftmost column, select only the alphanumeric characters and connect them, then he replaces every group of symbols between two alphanumeric characters by a space.

# Using his technique, try to decode this matrix:

#     7 3
#     Tsi
#     h%x
#     i #
#     sM 
#     $a 
#     #t%
#     ir!

# Bonus challenge (algo)

# Here is a python code that generate a list of 20000 random numbers, called list_of_numbers.

# Extend this code to guess how many couples of numbers in list_of_numbers sum to target_number.

# import random

# list_of_numbers = [random.randint(0, 10000) for _ in range(20000)]
# target_number   = 3728
