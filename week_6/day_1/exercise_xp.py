# Exercise 1
# Print this in one line of code:

# Hello world
# Hello world
# Hello world
# Hello world

# print(4 * "Hello world ")

# Exercise 2
# Calculate the result of: (99^3) * 8

# print((99 ^ 3) * 8)

# Exercise 3

#     Create a variable called name, and give it your name as a value (text)
#     Create a variable called age, and give it your age as a value (number)
#     Create a variable called shoe_size, and give it your shoe size as a value
#     Create a variable called info. Its value should be an interesting sentence about yourself, including your name, age, and shoe size. Use the variables you created earlier.
#     Write code so that when your script is run, the info message is prompt on the screen.
#     Run your code

# name = "joel"
# age = 29
# shoe_size = 10

# interesting_sentence = f"I'm {name}, I'm {29} years old, and I wear size {10} shoes. This isn't a very interesting sentence."

# print(interesting_sentence)

# Exercise 4

#     Create a variable called computer_brand that contains the brand of your computer. And then insert it to a sentence like "I have a razer computer"

# computer_brand = "Dell"
# print(f"Dude you got a {computer_brand}")

# this cool string interpolation thing is new in Python 3.6. I think it's pretty darn neat

# Exercise 5

#     Predict the output of the following code snippets:

# >>> 5 < 3 will return False

# >>> 3 == 3 will return True

# >>> 3 == "3" will return False

# >>> "3" > 3 will return a type error?

# >>> "Hello" == "hello" will return False

# Exercise 6

#     Write a little program that asks a user for his height (in inches) and determines whether people are tall enough to ride a roller coaster or not.

#         Minimum height is 35 inches

# height = input("How tall are you? ")

# if int(height) >= 35:
#     print("You can ride the roller coaster")
# else:
#     print("Sorry kid, you're too short to ride")

# Exercise 7

#     Write a little program that asks the user for a number and determines whether this number is odd or even.

# number = input("Gimme a number ")

# if int(number) % 2 == 0:
#     print("Even")
# else:
#     print("Odd")
