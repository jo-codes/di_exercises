# Exercise 1 – Random Sentence Generator

# Description: We will create a program that will generate a random sentence and display it to the user. We will allow the user to choose how long the sentence will be.

#     Download this word list
#     Save it in your development directory.
#     Create a function called get_words_from_file that will read the file’s contents and return them as a collection. What data type should you use?
#     Create another function called get_random_sentence. It should have a single parameter, length, which will be used to determine how many words the sentence should have. The function should get the words list, and choose random words from it, according to the amount specified by length.
#     The words should be joined together into a string, which should be formatted in lower case (or title case) and returned.
#     Create a main function. It should:
#     Print a message explaining what the program does.
#     Ask the user how long the sentence should be. Acceptable values: an integer between 2 and 20. Validate your data, and test your validation!
#         If the user inputs incorrect data, print an error message and end the program.
#         If the user inputs correct data, user your functions to create a random sentence, and then display it proudly to the user.
